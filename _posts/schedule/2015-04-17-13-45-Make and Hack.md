## Power you nail art
*Lisa*

Experimenting with LED's and fingernails (prototyping with Gorilla plastic, soldering, silver-conductor-coating etc.)

## Make your own "IoT" thing
*Philip P.*

Making a small Wifi enabled device using the common ESP8266 Wifi modules and LUA

## 3D Printing
*Chris W.*

Print stuff on a 3D printer - I will bring "Volker" (Velleman K8200), maybe "Merry Shelly" (Prusa Mendel i3), and maybe another one (Prusa Mendel i2) which is currently *under construction*. If they get broken during transportation it will be a repairing session :D
