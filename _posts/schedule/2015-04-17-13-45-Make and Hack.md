## Power you nail art
*Lisa*

Experimenting with LED's and fingernails (prototyping with Gorilla plastic, soldering, silver-conductor-coating etc.)

## Build your own IoT thing, based on an ESP8266 WiFi Module
*Philip P.*

The [ESP8266 IC](https://nurdspace.nl/ESP8266) is a small very affordable WiFi Chip with an integrated microcontroller. Aside from plain old `C`, the ESP8266 can also be programmed in [`LUA`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_%28programming_language%29) or from within the [`Arduino`](http://arduino.cc/) environment

The ease of programming combined with the affordable modules (3-5â‚¬) makes this an ideal entry point for a frugal IoT project.

As part of this session, you will build your own little development board, and use it to try out some basic IoT project.

*Requirements*
- A laptop

## 3D Printing
*Chris W.*

Print stuff on a 3D printer - I will bring "Volker" (Velleman K8200), maybe "Merry Shelly" (Prusa Mendel i3), and maybe another one (Prusa Mendel i2) which is currently *under construction*. If they get broken during transportation it will be a repairing session :D

## Programming Bots - Easy!
*Saleem*

Fun with [bots](https://www.makewonder.com/robots/dashanddot) !
